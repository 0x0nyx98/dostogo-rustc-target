error[E0382]: use of moved value: `foo`

   |         ---
   |         |
   |         this reinitialization might get skipped
   |         move occurs because `foo` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

   |         ---------------- inside of this loop

LL |                 baz.push(foo);
   |                          --- value moved here, in previous iteration of loop
...
LL |         qux.push(foo);
   |                  ^^^ value used here after move
   |
help: consider moving the expression out of the loop so it is only moved once

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
