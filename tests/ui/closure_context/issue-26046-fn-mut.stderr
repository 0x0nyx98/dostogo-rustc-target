   = help: the trait `Fn<()>` is not implemented for closure `{closure@$DIR/issue-26046-fn-mut.rs:4:19: 4:21}`
   = note: wrap the `{closure@$DIR/issue-26046-fn-mut.rs:4:19: 4:21}` in a closure with no arguments: `|| { /* code */ }`
   = note: `{closure@$DIR/issue-26046-fn-mut.rs:4:19: 4:21}` implements `FnMut`, but it must implement `Fn`, which is more general
   = note: required for the cast from `Box<{closure@$DIR/issue-26046-fn-mut.rs:4:19: 4:21}>` to `Box<(dyn Fn() + 'static)>`
