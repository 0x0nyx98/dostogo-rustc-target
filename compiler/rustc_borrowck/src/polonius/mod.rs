//! Polonius analysis and support code:
//! - dedicated constraints
//! - conversion from NLL constraints
//! - debugging utilities
//! - etc.
//!
//! The current implementation models the flow-sensitive borrow-checking concerns as a graph
//! containing both information about regions and information about the control flow.
//!
//! Loan propagation is seen as a reachability problem (with some subtleties) between where the loan
//! is introduced and a given point.
//!
//! Constraints arising from type-checking allow loans to flow from region to region at the same CFG
//! point. Constraints arising from liveness allow loans to flow within from point to point, between
//! live regions at these points.
//!
//! Edges can be bidirectional to encode invariant relationships, and loans can flow "back in time"
//! to traverse these constraints arising earlier in the CFG.
//!
//! When incorporating kills in the traversal, the loans reaching a given point are considered live.
//!
//! After this, the usual NLL process happens. These live loans are fed into a dataflow analysis
//! combining them with the points where loans go out of NLL scope (the frontier where they stop
//! propagating to a live region), to yield the "loans in scope" or "active loans", at a given
//! point.
//!
//! Illegal accesses are still computed by checking whether one of these resulting loans is
//! invalidated.
//!
//! More information on this simple approach can be found in the following links, and in the future
//! in the rustc dev guide:
//! - <https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/09/22/polonius-part-1/>
